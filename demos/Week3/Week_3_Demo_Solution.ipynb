        "* If you are starting out with firmware, DO NOT USE POINTERS! If you are practicing, fine. But if you want to write firmware that works, actively avoid using pointers at first. \n",
        "* Eventually, you will run into library functions that require you to use pointers. That will be a learning experience, but you will understand when it's appropriate to use pointers.\n",
        "* When you get enough experience using pointers through library functions, you will start to see opportunities to use pointers on your own. Then, you can utilize the power of the pointer.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's more important to understand WHEN to use pointers (or any feature of the language, for that matter). Most of the time, it will boil down to using pass by reference in some form or another. However, here are some more advanced usages:\n",
        "* dynamic memory allocation\n",
        "* multiple indirection (pointers to pointers)\n",
        "* Function pointers\n",
        "* void pointers\n",
        "* const pointers\n",
        "\n",
        "It's also worth mentioning that C++ offers a safer version of the pointer called a reference. References enable the pass-by-reference capability that you can do with pointers. Unlike pointers, you don't need to use the dereference operator to get the value pointed to by the reference; using the reference variable directly will yield the value. Under the hood, references are still pointers. However, there are some guardrails so you don't do something stupid."
