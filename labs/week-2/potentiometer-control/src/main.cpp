/**
 * For this lab, we're going to be reading from the potentiometer and outputting the
 * registered analog voltage to the led so that the led is mirroring the current
 * state of the potentiometer.  For this example, make sure that the signal pin
 * of the potentiometer is connected to pin A5 (SCL of the IMU).
 * 
 * Hint: Remember analogRead and analogWrite
