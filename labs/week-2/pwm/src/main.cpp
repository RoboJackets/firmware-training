/**
 * For the pwm lab, we're going to generate pwm in two different ways.
 * 
 * First, we're going to do the old-fashioned and (arguably) more
 * difficult way.  Using just digitalWrite and delayMicroseconds, generate
 * a pwm of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 with a period of 1 millisecond on led
 * 1.  Space the different measurements by 1 second
 * 
 * Next, to demonstrate that your pwm frequencies are correct, use
 * analogWrite to generate the same pwm values on led 2.
 * 
 * Hint: pwm is just on-time divided by the period
