## About this Repository

This repository will be updated each week to contain the solution to the last week's labs as well as the presentation for the current week.  All presentations will be present in the [presentations](./presentations/) folder.  Additionally, all labs will be in their respective week's directory within the [labs](./labs) folder.

## Week 1

In week 1, we will be learning what firmware is and what you can do with it.  Additionally, this lecture will discuss the basics of coding and digital inputs and outputs.

### Labs
