Welcome to the RoboJackets Firmware training repository!

## Training Schedule 2022

* Location: Skiles
* Time: 6:30pm - 8:00pm on Mondays and Wednesdays
* Bring: Your computer

Here is a breakdown of what firmware training is week-to-week:
* Week 0: Introductions, Electrical Basics*
* Week 1: Introduction to Prototyping and Arduino*
* Week 2: More C++ and Interrupts
* Week 3: PWM and Bitwise Operations
* Week 4: Communication Protocols
* Week 5: Debugging and Soldering*

NOTE: Weeks 0, 1, will be joint sessions between electrical and firmware held in electrical's classroom. Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4 will be held in the firmware training classroom. Week 5 is a special session, usually held in the Hive. You get to practice surface mount soldering and debugging firmware on an actual PCB.
